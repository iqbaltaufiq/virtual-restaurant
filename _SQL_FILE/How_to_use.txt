[ What is the password on each account? ]
I'm using the bcrypt() method to hash the password, and the actual password is a concatenation between username and the word 'pass'.

Example:
If an account has a username 'reus', then the password will be 'reuspass' (without quotes)
If an account has a username 'mb459', then the password will be 'mb459pass' (without quotes)
If an account has a username 'admin01', then the password will be 'admin01pass' (without quotes)
and so on...

And yes, this is just for testing purposes only. You should never create password with same patterns like that.
And you can create more account by either registering a new account via 'register' page or by using 'seeder' feature provided by Laravel.
